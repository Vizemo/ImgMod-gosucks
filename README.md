## Program 3 - Image Ascii Art
### Victor Marchesi
### Description:

- This project is going to allow you to utilize the packaging strengths of Go, and make your own libs that can be used anywhere just by running the go get ... command. I want you to create four packages in one module or four different modules. I'm ok with both options. However, one or three will be placed in your github account (not in your course repo).


### Files

#### 1.x is specifying the files are in a folder like 2.x is in another folder, etc.

|    #    | Files    | Description                      |
| :---: | -------- | -------------------------------- |
|    1    | [Colors](./Colors/) | P03 goLang imgMod colors package folder |
|    2    | [getPic](./getPic) | P03 goLang imgMod getPic package folder |
|    3    | [Grayscale](./Grayscale) | P03 goLang imgMod Grayscale package folder |
|    4    | [go.mod](./go.mod) | P03 goLang imgMod go.mod specifies how to package the modules |
|    5    | [go.work](./go.work) | P03 goLang imgMod go.work which tells the compiler where to find where the packages are located |
|    6    | [go.work.sum](./go.work.sum) | P03 goLang imgMod go.work.sum where the dependencies for the code is stored |
